Relation R(A,B,C) has the following tuples:

A B C
1 2 3
4 2 3
4 5 6
2 5 3
1 2 6

and relation S(A,B,C) has the following tuples:

A B C
2 5 3
2 5 4
4 5 6
1 2 3

The differences (R-S) is computed and the following tuple is found to be present in the result. Assume that the schema of the result is (A,B,C).

4, b, c

Find the integers b and c. Fill in the values in the answer box, each on a new line.
